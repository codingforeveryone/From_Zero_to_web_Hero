BOOKS

Eloquent Java Script
An absolute must for anyone looking to get stuck into JavaScript. I find myself referring to it all the time as I get more comfortable with the language. It contains plenty of interactive examples and exercises that'll stop you switching off mid-paragraph and ensure that you take something away with you every time you dip in.

Learning JavaScript Design Patterns
An interesting insight into recurrent patterns in JavaScript. Really helpful in developing a heightened awareness of the language that will save you time and energy when you come to implementing your own code. This book will help you become an efficient as well as a proficient user of JavaScript.

JavaScript Garden
Something to move on to after reading Eloquent Java Script and Learning JavaScript Design Patterns. This collection of documents is constantly being updated and attempts to tackle the most baffling corners of the language.
