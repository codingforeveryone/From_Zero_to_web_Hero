# From Zero to Web Hero
A journal of JavaScript reflections.

This repository is a pretty universal animal. It's open to anyone who would like to share their experiences in JavaScript - novices and experts alike. Most of us have at least one moment in the day's coding that stands out from the rest. Why not share it here as a mark down? See a mark down written by someone else you like, agree with or disagree with? Why not start a dialogue of issues?

The idea is to organise the material into directories as it builds up and observe the different categories of contributions people make. From this, we hope to identify trends in popularity of topics. This we can use to target and tackle general problem areas as a team, improve resource access for certain topics and in the long term, develop our own JavaScript learning resources.

There are no limits or constraints here. Feel free to contribute as much or as little as you like. The important thing is that you contribute *something*!
